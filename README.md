# Tetris-x86-64-Assembly
Tetris implemented in x86-64 assembly using the raylib library for the CSE1400 Computer Organisation course at TU Delft

## How to run ?
Firstly make sure you have the raylib library correctly installed!
Then you can run the game itself by:

- make tetris : assembles the game to a binary file (prepares the file to be run)
- make play : runs the game
- make clean : removes the binary file
